A turing machine is a theoretical device which has been proven to have the exact same computational power as a computer, assuming time is not a factor. 
A turing machine has an infinitely long tape as it's input and it begins by reading the leftmost space which has a character. At each space it must do 3 things:
- Read the character at that space
- Write a new character at that space
- Move either one space to the left or one space to the right
